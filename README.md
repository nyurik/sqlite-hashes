Use this crate to add various hash functions to SQLite, including MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512. All functions support text and blob values. Functions support any number of parameters which will be hashed in order. `NULL` values will be ignored. The functions return a blob with the hash value unless all parameters are `NULL`, in which case `NULL` is returned.

There are also aggregate functions that compute combined hash over a set of values, e.g. `sha256_concat`. These functions are useful for computing hash over a set of values, e.g. a column in a table. The aggregate functions also support multiple values, so you can compute a hash over a set of columns, e.g. `sha256_concat(col1, col2, col3)` over a whole set. 

This crate uses [rusqlite](https://crates.io/crates/rusqlite) to add user-defined functions using static linking. Eventually it would be good to build dynamically loadable extension binaries usable from other languages (PRs welcome).

## Usage

```rust
use sqlite_hashes::{register_hash_functions, rusqlite::Connection};

fn main() {
  // Connect to SQLite DB and register needed hashing functions
  let db = Connection::open_in_memory().unwrap();
  // can also use hash-specific ones like register_sha256_function(&db)  
  register_hash_functions(&db).unwrap();

  // Hash 'password' using SHA-256, and dump resulting BLOB as a HEX string
  let sql = "SELECT hex(sha256('password'))";
  let hash: String = db.query_row_and_then(&sql, [], |r| r.get(0)).unwrap();
  assert_eq!(hash, "5E884898DA28047151D0E56F8DC6292773603D0D6AABBDD62A11EF721D1542D8");

  // Same as above, but use sha256_hex() function to dump the result as a HEX string directly
  let sql = "SELECT sha256_hex('password')";
  let hash: String = db.query_row_and_then(&sql, [], |r| r.get(0)).unwrap();
  assert_eq!(hash, "5E884898DA28047151D0E56F8DC6292773603D0D6AABBDD62A11EF721D1542D8");

  // Hash 'pass' (as text) and 'word' (as blob) using SHA-256, and dump it as a HEX string
  // The result is the same as the above 'password' example.
  let sql = "SELECT sha256_hex(cast('pass' as text), cast('word' as blob))";
  let hash: String = db.query_row_and_then(&sql, [], |r| r.get(0)).unwrap();
  assert_eq!(hash, "5E884898DA28047151D0E56F8DC6292773603D0D6AABBDD62A11EF721D1542D8");

  // Iterate over a set of values and hash them together.
  // Make sure the value order is consistent.
  // This example creates a sequence of ints from 0 to 9.
  let sql = "
      WITH RECURSIVE sequence(value) AS (
        SELECT 0 UNION ALL SELECT value + 1 FROM sequence LIMIT 10
      )
      SELECT sha256_hex_concat(cast(value as text))
      FROM sequence
      ORDER BY value";
  let hash: String = db.query_row_and_then(&sql, [], |r| r.get(0)).unwrap();
  assert_eq!(hash, "84D89877F0D4041EFB6BF91A16F0248F2FD573E6AF05C19F96BEDB9F882F7882");
  
  // The above sequence aggregation example is equivalent to this:
  let sql = "SELECT sha256_hex('0123456789')";
  let hash: String = db.query_row_and_then(&sql, [], |r| r.get(0)).unwrap();
  assert_eq!(hash, "84D89877F0D4041EFB6BF91A16F0248F2FD573E6AF05C19F96BEDB9F882F7882");
}
```

## Features
By default, this crate will compile with all hash functions. You can enable just the ones you need to reduce compile time.

```toml
[dependencies]
sqlite-hashes = { version = "0.4", default-features = false, features = ["hex", "window", "sha256"] }
``` 

## Development
* This project is easier to develop with [just](https://github.com/casey/just#readme), a modern alternative to `make`. Install it with `cargo install just`.
* To get a list of available commands, run `just`.
* To run tests, use `just test`.
* On `git push`, it will run a few validations, including `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test`.  Use `git push --no-verify` to skip these checks.
